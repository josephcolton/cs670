# **Data**

My wife works at Peace Health Sacred Heard Medical Center at River Bend
in the Mom/Baby unit and sometimes in the NICU. I am regularly hearing
about challenges related to birth and complications. My wife and I
sometimes talk about the idea of her going to a foreign country to do
one of the doctors without borders types of trips. I decided that
looking into infant mortality and possible causes might be interesting.

I logged into Kaggle and used a data set from Utkarsh S, who goes by the
username/handle of Zeus. It appears that this is one of three data sets
that he contributed. Originally, I was under the impression that the
data sets on Kaggle were curated by the Kaggle organization, but now, it
appears that the data sets are more like getting code and projects from
GitHub.

The dataset I used was called the "World Health Statistics 2020". It
seems that Zeus collected the data from the World Health Organization,
but he does not directly state it in his data card. If I were to do this
project all over again, I would probably gather the data from the World
Health Organization site myself and clean it up myself.

I selected 10 CSV files from the data set and downloaded them. Each CSV
file consists of a location (ie. country), and period (ie. year), an
indicator describing the data, and a statistic. There are sometimes
additional pieces of information that are used to break up the data.
Much of the data had column descriptions that were not very useful, so I
renamed the column headings. There were a few pieces of data that could
not be used as is, so I had to write R regular expressions to remove
extra data.

I used the following CSV files:

alcoholSubstanceAbuse.csv - Location, Year, Indicator, Dim1,
AlcoholPercent

atLeastBasicSanitizationServices.csv - Location, Indicator, Year, Dim1,

# Questions

Through all of this research, I had a large question and some smaller
questions that I decided to ask. My interest is in infant mortality. The
main question is how to prevent it. But in order to do that, I decided
to look at different suspicions to see what kind of correlation exists.
Finally, I wanted to try using related data to see if I could predict
infant mortality. Ideally, if the source of infant mortality is
identified, we could then potentially make changes to make like better
for the babies.

-   How can we reduce infant mortality?

-   Does the presence of nurses and midwives correlate with infant
    mortality?

-   What basic health needs correlate with infant mortality?

-   Do alcohol, tobacco, and violence correlate with infant mortality?

Using the data available I would like to see what patterns I can
identify and which predictors seem to correlate with infant mortality.

# Visualization

## **Birth and Medical Personal**

I wanted to see what role the presence of medical personal in the
country as well as actually attending the birth played in longer term
infant mortality.

**Births Attended by Skilled Personnel**

I wanted to see if having skilled personnel played a role in infant
mortality. It appears that as the percent of skilled personnel drops,
infant mortality rises. This indicates a definite correlation with
infant mortality.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(skilledBirth, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$SkilledBirthPercent, main="Births Attended by Skilled Personnel", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="Attended by Skilled Personnel %", col="blue")
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ SkilledBirthPercent, data=data)
abline(lm.fit, col="green", lwd=3)
```

**Nursing and Midwifery personnel**

I looked at how the ratio of midwifes and nurses to population played a
role in infant mortality. It appears that if the number of midwives and
nurses is high, the infant mortality is low. However, when the number is
low, the infant mortality is sometimes high and sometimes low. I am now
wondering if wealth might play a role in who gets service. It is
possible that someone might be in a country with a lot of skilled
personnel, but not be able to have them at the birth.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(nursingAndMidwife, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$NursingPersonnel, main="Presence of Nurses and Midwives", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="Midwives/Nursing per 10,000 people", col="blue")
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ NursingPersonnel, data=data)
abline(lm.fit, col="green", lwd=3)
```

## **Basic Health Needs**

An area of interest for I wanted to look at was basic health needs. I
looked at sanitation, access to clean drinking water, hand washing, and
safely managed sanitation services. It appears that all of these are
important and help an infant survive.

**Basic Level of Sanitation**

The first plot shows the correlation between basic sanitation in the
population and infant mortality. This shows that as the basic sanitation
rates drop, the infant mortality rate rises.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(basicSanitization, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$BasicSaniPercent, main="Basic Sanitation and Infant Mortality", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="People with Basic Sanitation %", col="blue")
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ BasicSaniPercent, data=data)
abline(lm.fit, col="green", lwd=3)
```

**Access to Clean Drinking Water**

In addition to sanitation, access to clean drinking water appears to be
correlated with infant mortality. As the percent of people with access
to clean drinking water goes up, the infant mortality rate drops.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(drinkingWater, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$DrinkingWaterPercent, main="Drinking Water and Infant Mortality", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="People with Drinking Water %", col="blue")
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ DrinkingWaterPercent, data=data)
abline(lm.fit, col="green", lwd=3)
```

**Access to Hand Washing Facilities in the Home**

Access to hand washing facilities in the home correlates with lower
infant mortality rates. This appears to show that when you have access
to wash hands, babies have a better chance at life.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(handWashing, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$HomeHandWashPercent, main="Home Hand Washing and Infant Mortality", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="People with Hand Washing in the Home %", col="blue")
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ HomeHandWashPercent, data=data)
abline(lm.fit, col="green", lwd=3)
```

**Managed Safe Sanitation Services**

As people get safely managed sanitation services, the infant mortality
rate drops. This indicates that safely managed sanitation services play
a positive role in the health of infants.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(safelySanitization, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$SafeSaniPercent, main="Safe Sanitation Services and Infant Mortality", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="People with managed sanitation services %", col="blue")
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ SafeSaniPercent, data=data)
abline(lm.fit, col="green", lwd=3)
```

## **Drugs and Violence**

After looking at sanitation conditions, I decided to look at drugs use
(tobacco, alcohol) and domestic violence against women to see if there
are correlations there that might indicate places for possible
improvement.

**Alcohol Use**

I wanted to see what role alcohol use might play in infant mortality. I
plotted the alcohol use against the infant mortality rate. It appears
that with various levels of alcohol consumption, the infant mortality
rate does not appear as affected. There is not a lot of information I
can gather from this, but it seems that this is not likely a cause of
infant mortality.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(alcoholAbuse, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$AlcoholPercent, main="Alcohol Use and Infant Mortality", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="Annual Alcohol Consumption in Litres/Capita", col="blue")
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ AlcoholPercent, data=data)
abline(lm.fit, col="green", lwd=3)
```

**Tobacco Use**

The next plot shows the affects of tobacco use in the population and the
correlation with infant mortality. While visually it does appear that
there is a slight correlation between tobacco use and infant mortality,
it does not appear to be a strong indicator. There are more likely
stronger indicators at play here.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(tobacco, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$TobaccoPercent, main="Tobacco Use and Infant Mortality", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="Tobacco users %", col="blue")
lines(y=c(0, 100), x=c(0,150), col="green", lwd=3)
```

**Domestic Violence**

I decided to look and see what role domestic violence against women, by
an intimate partner in the last 12 months, in the age range that might
be giving birth might play on infant mortality. Interestly, it appears
that as the rate of women who experience domestic violence from an
intimate partner goes up, so does the infant mortality. This leads me to
believe that it is not just women who are experiencing this domestic
violence. It is possible that those in these circumstances do not value
life as much, or other factors in their environment hurts the survival
rate of infants.

```{r}
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality, select=-c(Indicator)),
              subset(violence, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))

plot(data$InfantMortRate, data$ViolencePercent, main="Violence against Women and Infant Mortality", xlab="Infant Mortality per 1000 births", ylab="Women subjected to violence %", col="blue")
lines(y=c(0, 60), x=c(0,120), col="green", lwd=3)
```

# Models

I decided to train models to predict the infant mortality using the
different possible predictors, then compare the results to actual
numbers in testing data. I decided to go for a 80/20 split of
training/testing data.

**Sanitation/Water Predictions**

First, I decided to look at the sanitation data. One of the problems I
ran into is that not every country reported for every year for all 4 of
the predictors I decided to use. This means that I was limited to only
172 rows of data. If I were to do this over, I would use interpolated
data to fill in gaps and see what I could figure out.

```{r}
set.seed(0) # Set random number seed
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality[infantMortality$Dim1 == 'Both sexes',], select=-c(Indicator, Dim1)),
              subset(basicSanitization[basicSanitization$Dim1 == 'Total',], select=-c(Indicator, Dim1)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))
data <- merge(data,
              subset(safelySanitization[safelySanitization$Dim1 == 'Total',], select=-c(Indicator, Dim1)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))
data <- merge(data,
              subset(drinkingWater, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))
data <- merge(data,
              subset(handWashing[handWashing$Dim1 == 'Total',], select=-c(Indicator, Dim1)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))
data <- subset(data, select=-c(Location, Year))

# Create an 80-20 split of the data
#trainIndex <- createDataPartition(data$InfantMortRate, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
#training <- data[trainIndex, ]
#testing <- data[-trainIndex, ]
training <- data[0:137,]
testing <- data[138:172,]

# Create a linear model
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ ., data=training)
# summary(lm.fit)

# Make predictions on the testing data
predictions <- predict(lm.fit, newdata = testing)

# Compare predictions to actual values in testing
results <- data.frame(Actual = testing$InfantMortRate, Predicted = predictions)

# Create a scatter plot of predicted vs. actual values
ggplot(results, aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Actual Infant Mortality Rate", y = "Predicted Infant Mortality Rate") +
  ggtitle("Predicted vs. Actual Infant Mortality Rate")

```

**Skilled Professionals Predictions**

I decided to use the skilled professionals being present at the birth to
help predict the infant mortality rate. There were a few outliers along
the left side, that seemed interesting, but overall, it seemed like the
skilled professionals being there was a good predictor for infant
mortality.

```{r}
set.seed(0) # Set random number seed
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality[infantMortality$Dim1 == 'Both sexes',], select=-c(Indicator, Dim1)),
              subset(skilledBirth, select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))
data <- subset(data, select=-c(Location, Year))

# Create an 80-20 split of the data
#trainIndex <- createDataPartition(data$InfantMortRate, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
#training <- data[trainIndex, ]
#testing <- data[-trainIndex, ]
training <- data[0:1200,]
testing <- data[1201:1596,]

# Create a linear model
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ ., data=training)
# summary(lm.fit)

# Make predictions on the testing data
predictions <- predict(lm.fit, newdata = testing)

# Compare predictions to actual values in testing
results <- data.frame(Actual = testing$InfantMortRate, Predicted = predictions)

# Create a scatter plot of predicted vs. actual values
ggplot(results, aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 10, slope = 0.1, color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Actual Infant Mortality Rate", y = "Predicted Infant Mortality Rate") +
  ggtitle("Predicted vs. Actual Infant Mortality Rate")

```

**Violence against Women**

While the rate at which women experience violence from an intimate
partner does not seem like it should correlate with the infant mortality
rate, viewing the data earlier appeared to show a correlation, so I
decided to try using it to predict the infant mortality rate. I had a
lot of missing data, but the data that I did have seemed to do a good
job of predicting the infant mortality rate. It would be interesting to
see if we could look into causation to see why these two might
correlate.

```{r}
set.seed(0) # Set random number seed
data <- merge(subset(infantMortality[infantMortality$Dim1 == 'Both sexes',], select=-c(Indicator, Dim1)),
              subset(violence[violence$Dim2 == '25-29 years',], select=-c(Indicator)),
              by=c("Location", "Year"))
data <- subset(data, select=-c(Location, Year, Dim1, Dim2))

# Create an 80-20 split of the data
#trainIndex <- createDataPartition(data$InfantMortRate, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
#training <- data[trainIndex, ]
#testing <- data[-trainIndex, ]
training <- data[0:35,]
testing <- data[36:44,]

# Create a linear model
lm.fit <- lm(InfantMortRate ~ ., data=training)
# summary(lm.fit)

# Make predictions on the testing data
predictions <- predict(lm.fit, newdata = testing)

# Compare predictions to actual values in testing
results <- data.frame(Actual = testing$InfantMortRate, Predicted = predictions)

# Create a scatter plot of predicted vs. actual values
ggplot(results, aes(x = Actual, y = Predicted)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(intercept = 30, slope = 1.8, color = "red") +
  labs(x = "Actual Infant Mortality Rate", y = "Predicted Infant Mortality Rate") +
  ggtitle("Predicted vs. Actual Infant Mortality Rate")
```

# Results, Analysis, and Discussion

Looking at all of the data and visuals, I see that infant mortality is a
complex issue. Clearly, there are signs that sanitation and clean water
is related to infant mortality. If I had unlimited money, I would love
to perform an experiment where I built sanitation services and clean
water facilities in countries without easy access to these services. I
would like to then make sure that people had access to sanitation
services and clean water, then see how the infant mortality rate was
affected. Either way, an improvement in sanitation services and clean
water would be a positive change for some people.

The rate at which skilled professionals are present at the birth is
correlated with infant mortality and can be used to fairly accurately
predict rates, however, causation is hard to establish. It would be nice
if the data was more complete and individual cases of infant mortality
could be looked at more closely to see if there were direct correlations
to skilled professionals. What I have to work with are two aggregate
numbers that correlate, but are not directly tied together. It seems
like having skilled professionals at the birth is definitely a positive
thing and should be encouraged.

I really thought that alcohol and tobacco use would be good predictors
of infant mortality, but it seems that is not the case. While I imagine
these are tied to overall life expectancy and death from other causes,
it does not appear that they significantly lead to infant mortality. The
violence against women numbers showed me something I was not fully
expecting. I thought it was possible that women who experienced violence
from an intimate partner might also have children that experienced that
same violence or they might cause it themselves, but I did not expect it
to have such a close correlation. The violence numbers worked as a good
predictor for infant mortality, which is a sad thing.

My analysis a fairly limited in that I use linear regression instead of
more fitted approaches. It is possible that the numbers could have been
better predictors if I had used different models. Another limitation was
the source of and quality of data that I was using. I would have liked
to have modified the data to fix some of the missing numbers by using
estimates.

If I were to do this all over, I would have collected and used more
data. I would have liked to see things like education levels and other
quality of life indicators such as income/GDP. I would have also liked
to look at things like food security, political unrest, and birth/birch
control policies.

# Impact

The data seems to tell a certain story. I used the location and year
fields to merge data, but this data could be used to tell other
political stories. We have to be careful what conclusions are drawn from
the data and analysis.

I identified the following places where I would make recommendations in
order to improve infant mortality rates in a given country:

1.  Governments and businesses should invest in improving sanitation and
    clean water infrastructure. Improving these makes life better and
    reduced the infant mortality rates.

2.  Governments should encourage more people to become nurses/midwives.
    They could create training programs and offer scholarships and
    grants for people in under-served areas who are interested in
    learning how to become skilled professionals. Then, they should make
    sure access to skilled professionals is available during pregnancy.

3.  Governments should look at law and social practices that might lead
    to domestic violence. Ideally, governments and society should frown
    on domestic violence of any sort and discourage it.

While all of these basically focus on government playing a role, it
might need to be done by communities or religions.

While I think my models are fairly accurate, it is possible that they
are not accurate. Either way, all of the suggestions I suggested are
considered positive things in general, so none of the suggestions really
has a negative consequence, with possibly the suggestion about domestic
violence. If I was wrong, I do not expect the infant mortality rates to
raise, most likely, they would be unaffected.
